To work around this issue, use `max()` to ensure that the calculated value is never negative:

```css
.element {
  width: max(0, calc(50% - 200px));
}
```

This ensures that if the calculation results in a negative value, the width will be set to 0 instead, preventing unexpected layout behavior.  Alternatively, you can adjust your layout or calculations to avoid the possibility of negative values altogether.
